### Priority Queues

In this project, 3 different priority queues (PQ) have been implemented, a sorted PQ, a binary PQ, and a pairing PQ.
The sorted PQ implements the priority queue interface by maintaining a sorted vector.
The binary heap PQ implements the priority queue interface by maintaining a binary tree indexed into a vector (where
