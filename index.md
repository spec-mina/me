### Stock Market Simulation

This is a stock market simulation like project, where the program receives a series of "orders," or intentions to buy or sell shares of a certain stock. As each order comes in, the program sees if the new order can be matched with any previous orders. 

Instead of matching buyers and sellers of a stock, this program matches Jedi and Sith battalions for battle! This means buy/sell are Sith/Jedi, stocks are planets, price is force-sensitivity, etc. Check out the spec and the code [here](https://gitfront.io/r/spec-mina/zimDBG2adFKQ/Stock-Market-Simulation/)!
